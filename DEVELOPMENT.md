# MaterialX Development Environment
## Autodesk Fork 
- https://github.com/materialx/MaterialX
- This is where Autodesk specific additions to ASWF main fork reside.
- Any areas of core which are not part of main should be resolved. ADSK core and ASWF core should always be in sync per release.
- Additions include things like additional code generators, utilities etc.
- Branches:
    - The main branch should be kept up to date with ASWF main. Nothing ever gets merged back to this main branch.
    - The `adsk_contrib/dev` : is the main working branch
        - Tagged released corresponding to ASWF releases are based on this branch.
    - If and only if needed a new release branch can be created. Thus far this has never been done.

## Status / Releases
- 	The general wiki is here (https://github.com/autodesk-forks/MaterialX/wiki). Please keep this up to date.
- 	Every release of ASWF should have a corresponding ADSK release. The ASWF tag names are v<major>.<minor><patch>. The ASDK tag names include a prefix of _adsk.
    - Note that distributions are still manually added back in though possibly an action could be added for this.
    - E.g.

## Contributing
### Issues
- Before starting work, if non-trivial should be checked with ASWF gatekeepers. The ASWF #materialx Slack channel is a good place to start. This is for both implementations and required for specification changes.
- An issue can be raised either on the ASWF repo if a common item.

- If ADSK specific an issue can be added in the ADSK fork issue section.

    - Please add labels as appropriate, release number should be checked with the ADSK owner, and assignments added as needed. The ASWF repo has no labels at time of writing.
    - There is a [project Kanban board](https://github.com/autodesk-forks/MaterialX/projects) which is automated.

### Coding and Pull Requests
- 	All work in progress should have branch off of `adsk_contrib/dev` with a name `adsk_contrib/<name of work>` if origin is from ADSK.
- 	All work if possible, should be relative to ASWF main. The easiest thing to do is update ADSK `main` and create a branch off of it.
- 	PRâ€™s when ready should be directly against ASWF main though it can be committed to the ADSK branch first for CI/CD testing

- 	All PRs should 
o	Reference a github issue and/or ADSK JIRA issue if  applicable.
o	Include at least one reviewer. ASWF members can be added as necessary.
o	Should have a release tag for tracking.
o	The CHANGELOG.md should be updated as needed.

## CI/CD and other Automated Processes
- ADSK has a slight variation on Github actions in that not all configurations are configuration for a push commit.
- A PR will trigger the exact same pipeline as the ASWF one.
  - PRs are hooked up to Codacy for static analysis.
  - There is only one workflow file (main.yml) which handles desktop and web CI.

- The web CI will update the associated github page on PRs.

- `dependabot` is used to check and automatically create PRs for package dependency security issues. Admins can control the configuration of this.
